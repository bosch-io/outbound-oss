# Guiding principles
The procedure described in the following is designed to ensure that the company interests and its employees are protected. We also need to make sure that contributions are in line with copyright law, export regulations, data protection regulations and open source development best practices. On the other hand, procedural burden for all to be involved stakeholders should be low and the approval procedure should not take too much time.

## Decision rests with Unit

* The approval procedure is the responsibility of the organizational unit that paid for the development of the code in question
* If the affected code/IP is used, co-developed or co-financed by other Units, involve them as stakeholders in the release decision

## Lean procedure

* The tasks to be carried out by the developer should be clear, simple, and cause as little effort as possible
* The potential complexity of the “backend tasks” should not be visible to the developer. The current status of the request shall be visible to the developer

## Boundary conditions

* Protect our employees and our business interests
* Act in compliance with law, internal and external regulations
* Provide transparency to the decision makers on what and how much of the companies code and IP will be affected by the publication
* All the contributions shall be made with the “company”-email (similar for the github activity) so that all contributions of the company can be identified easily.
* Respect the rules and customs of the OSS ecosystem and of the target OSS project

# Procedure for contributions to existing projects

Why is there a need for a certain procedure at all? First of all the copyright law requires it. 
For example the German copyright act states in Section 69b
Authors in employment or service relationships
> (1) Where a computer program is created by an employee in the execution of his duties or following the instructions of his employer, the employer exclusively shall be entitled to exercise all economic rights in the computer program, unless otherwise agreed.

Source: [German Copyright Act](https://dejure.org/gesetze/UrhG/69b.html)

which in the end means that all the software developed in this context is the property of the employer i.e. the company the developer is working for. At least the German copyright act does not limit the proprietorship to code developed during working hours or within the company IT infrastructure, it only scopes the context. 

**But what to do in case an employee wants to contribute to OSS projects which do not fall under the above mentioned context? - also known as "moonlighting"**

In this case the copyright ownership stays with the developer (assuming he/she is not developing for another entity). In order to provide clarity and avoid confusing the following procedure can be implemented:
The developer informs his manager about the intention to contribute to a certain project (which is out of scope in regard to section 69b) in case the manager has not objections they draft a small note with at least the following content:
* date of the meeting
* project(s) the employee wants to contribute to
* estimated hours per week
* approval by the manager
* signature of the developer
* signature of the manager

Transferring the note to the HR department to keep it in the personnel record.

This procedure provides transparency especially in the context of large enterprises, acting in many different software technology areas. 

A developer may for example implement Linux kernel drivers according to his duties. Another area of interest of the developer is for example KI and the developer wants to contribute to TensorFlow during his spare time. 
Obviously TensorFlow has nothing to do with Linux kernel driver development, so the developer holds copyright on his contributions and the copyright ownership is not transferred to the employer. The developer can contribute code without the need of an approval of his employer.

But what about when the developer decides to move to another department inside the company, which develops KI. All of a sudden the former "free time activity" is covered by section 69b of the copyright act and the copyright owner now is the employer.

The above described procedure provides transparency about the copyright ownership and its change during the time.


**What to do in case the contribution falls under the above mentioned section of the copyright act?**

A procedure is required, which
* protects the companies business interests of the employer
* protects the employee

Last but not least public code is like the business card of a company as well as of the developer who has written the code.

The more complex the business environment in which the code to publish was developed, the more stakeholders need to be involved. The picture below shows a procedure that involves all functions, even in a complex setup.

The procedure described above is not suited for frequent contributors and/or contributors who are working “upstream” in their daily work. For these developers different procedures need to be established in order to avoid loading them with “unproductive” work.
The following approaches are suited for such developers:
* small contributions model
* major to major release model
* full trust model

![small-contributions](./img/small-contributions.png)

## Small contributions Model or trivial contributions

A small or trivial contribution is a rather small and simple change to already existing open source software. Typical cases found in this category are bug fixes and error corrections with no or low Intellectual Property value. 
A change is not trivial if: 
* Functionality is added or changed. 
* The interface of the open source software component is changed. 
* It is an optimization that more than insignificantly increases performance. 
* It contains a design or an algorithm that wouldn’t be obvious for a software engineer.

This procedure scopes small contributions. It can be followed for small or trivial contributions following the initial contribution to a particular OSS project or component. The initial contribution has to implement the entire procedure described above, because CLAs / DCOs etc. have to be checked  and signed in case the particular project requires them.
After the initial contribution all subsequent small contributions can be contributed directly to the OSS project without the need to follow the defined process no matter which version of the OSS project.

## Major to major release model

This procedure scopes the release cycle of the OSS project where contributions shall be made to. It has the same “starting point” like any other contribution - the initial contribution has to implement the entire procedure in order to check CLAs / DCOs and to have the documented permission to contribute to a specific project. After the initial contribution all subsequent contributions during the development of a new major release can be contributed to the OSS project without the need to go through the approval process. There is no size limitation for contributions. The contributions can range from a trivial bug fix to adding new features, changing interfaces, refactoring and so on. After the release of a major version of the project a new approval procedure has to be kicked off for the first contribution after the major release.

## Full trust model

The full trust model can be applied to developers who have already successfully worked under the major to major release model. It is an incentive for the employee and a sign of confidence of the employer towards the employee. Basically it is the allowance for the developer to work “upstream” without any approval procedure. Since this model shall only be applied after the developer worked successfully under the major to major release model, there is no need for an  “initial” contribution with the entire approval procedure, although it makes sense in order to have it documented. 

The Major to major release model as well as the full trust model shall only be executed by  senior developers, who are specially trained in copyright principles, have a good understanding of the business interests of the company they are working for, practice “an ownership culture” and have already deep experience in the open source ecosystem. 
In order to track all the contributions the developers shall contribute with their official email / github id.

## Other models

Beside the above mentioned models many different can be defined, like "contributions to a defined set of OSS projects are allowed without an approval". No matter whether and which kind of "lightweight" variants will be defined, the proper awareness and education of the contributing developers is key.
