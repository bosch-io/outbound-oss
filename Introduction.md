# Introduction

## Goal and target audience

This guide is about how to contribute to or to launch an open source project (also called "outbound open source") as a company. It aims to describe a complete and lean process, that can be implemented in companies of any size (large but also small or medium sized organizations). Companies can tailor the proposed procedure to their needs. I.e., depending on the size and situation of the company not all steps need to be implemented.

## Maturity levels

Corporate adoption of open source software (OSS) can typically be classified with a model of maturity levels. These levels describe how OSS is used in an increasingly effective fashion to drive value and address business needs. One of the distinguishing factors for the different maturity levels is how outbound open source is handled in an organization. The insight that influencing the open source ecosystem is mainly done by participation in and contributing to open source projects is seen as a critcal factor.

A typical maturity model of corporate open source adoption looks like this (see for example [Haddad: Open Source Program Offices](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/open-source-program-offices-primer-organizational-roles-haddad)):

0. Denial - No or unconscious use of open source
1. Consumption - Passive use of open source software
2. Participation - Engagement with open source communities
3. Contribution - Pragmatic contributions to open source projects
4. Leadership - Strategic involvement with open source to drive business value

To advance from one level to another, certain initiatives and structural and organizational elements are required.

Going from consumption to participation, for example, will start with informal engagement and low-effort activities such as reporting bugs in upstream projects, which typically is driven by technical needs. On thet level, decisions about open source contributions will normally be ad-hoc and be taken for individual cases only.

Establishing dedicated decision making processes and formalizing contribution policies will lead to the next level. A typical step on this level is to establish an Open Source Program Office to support open source engagement and maintain an open source strategy and processes.

On the leadership level, contribution processes are mature and scale. Corresponding tool chains are implemented. Own projects with the goal to create new open source communities are started if that's required and appropriate. This will typically come with leveraging open source foundations to enable cross-company collaboration to strategically use open source to accelerate creating business value.

A company may decide to not progress to levels which are based on more contributions, and it's of course possible to build mature processes to consume open source software without contributing. In most cases, there will be some pressure to contribute back, though. This can arise from practical technical needs (missing functionalities or required bug fixes are typical reasons for contributing to open souirce projects), from the expectation to take responsibility in the open source ecosystem, or from the desire to reap the full benefits of the open source model.

## How companies manage open source: Open Source Program Offices

An increasing number of organizations realized the tasks of managing open source in an enterprise and complex relationships that are inherent to the open source ecosystem when they are advancing in their engagement in open source. For this reason, many of them invest start Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs), something called differently, for example Open Source Technology Centers, Open Source Community Development Team etc. OSPOs are a designated place where open source is supported, nurtured, shared, explained, and grown inside an organization. With such an office in place, businesses can establish and execute on their open source strategies in clear terms and responsibilities, giving their leaders, developers, marketers, and other staff the processes and tools they need to make open source a success within their operations.

The TODO Group offers a [set of guides](https://todogroup.org/guides/) on how to get started with an OSPO. Companies that are new to this topic, might want to first take a look at [**How to create an open source program**](https://todogroup.org/guides/create-program/)

## Motivation fory to contributing to or starting own open source projects

There are many different reasons for companies to contribute to existing open source projects. To provide insights into the broad spectrum of motivations, we list some examples below. However, we do not claim to be complete.

* Build software faster and better
  * Integrating "own" features into upstream projects makes maintenance a lot easier
  * Upstream versions can be directly used in own products and services
  * More features are obtained in shorter period of time
  * Higher quality is achieved in shorter period of time
  * Support available from core experts
* Exercise strategic influence
  * Safeguard free of charge access to certain functionality
  * Gain (co)copyright on OSS packages
  * Influence the direction of upstream open source projects
  * Establish de facto standards
  * Access to the creativity of everyone interested in software
  * Keep competitors out of certain market segments
  * New ways of collaboration with suppliers and customers may be established
  * Create and maintain ecosystems
* Attract, grow and retain talents
  * Increase developer satisfaction
  * Peer review of each contribution by core experts improves quality and boosts developer skills
  * Make company visible as an attractive employer
  * Improve company's reputation, and with it the standing of developers in their communities
* Get closer to the customer
  * Establish new ways of collaborating with suppliers and customers
