# Introduction

## Goal and target audience

This guide is about how to contribute to or to launch an open source project (also called "outbound open source") as a company. It aims to describe a complete and lean process, that can be implemented in companies of any size (large but also small or medium sized organizations). Companies can tailor the proposed procedure to their needs. I.e., depending on the size and situation of the company not all steps need to be implemented.

## Maturity levels

Corporate adoption of open source software (OSS) can typically be classified with a model of maturity levels. These levels describe how OSS is used in an increasingly effective fashion to drive value and address business needs. One of the distinguishing factors for the different maturity levels is how outbound open source is handled in an organization. The insight that influencing the open source ecosystem is mainly done by participation in and contributing to open source projects is seen as a critcal factor.

A typical maturity model of corporate open source adoption looks like this (see for example [Haddad: Open Source Program Offices](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/open-source-program-offices-primer-organizational-roles-haddad)):

0. Denial - No or unconscious use of open source
1. Consumption - Passive use of open source software
2. Participation - Engagement with open source communities
3. Contribution - Pragmatic contributions to open source projects
4. Leadership - Strategic involvement with open source to drive business value

To advance from one level to another, certain initiatives and structural and organizational elements are required.

Going from consumption to participation, for example, will start with informal engagement and low-effort activities such as reporting bugs in upstream projects, which typically is driven by technical needs. On that level, decisions about open source contributions will normally be ad-hoc and be taken for individual cases only.

Establishing dedicated decision making processes and formalizing contribution policies will lead to the next level. A typical step on this level is to establish an Open Source Program Office to support open source engagement and maintain an open source strategy and processes.

On the leadership level, contribution processes are mature and scale. Corresponding tool chains are implemented. Own projects with the goal to create new open source communities are started if that's required and appropriate. This will typically come with leveraging open source foundations to enable cross-company collaboration to strategically use open source to accelerate creating business value.

A company may decide to not progress to levels which are based on more contributions, and it's of course possible to build mature processes to consume open source software without contributing. In most cases, there will be some pressure to contribute back, though. This can arise from practical technical needs (missing functionalities or required bug fixes are typical reasons for contributing to open souirce projects), from the expectation to take responsibility in the open source ecosystem, or from the desire to reap the full benefits of the open source model.

## How companies manage open source: Open Source Program Offices

An increasing number of organizations realized the tasks of managing open source in an enterprise and complex relationships that are inherent to the open source ecosystem when they are advancing in their engagement in open source. For this reason, many of them start Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs), something called differently, for example Open Source Technology Centers, Open Source Community Development Team etc. OSPOs are a designated place where open source is supported, nurtured, shared, explained, and grown inside an organization. With such an office in place, businesses can establish and execute on their open source strategies in clear terms and responsibilities, giving their leaders, developers, marketers, and other staff the processes and tools they need to make open source a success within their operations.

The TODO Group offers a [set of guides](https://todogroup.org/guides/) on how to get started with an OSPO. Companies that are new to this topic, might want to first take a look at [**How to create an open source program**](https://todogroup.org/guides/create-program/)

## Motivation for open source contribution

There is a broad spectrum of motivations for contributing to open source projects or starting new projects. Here, we can only list some examples.

### Build software faster and better

Consuming open source software typically increases the development speed and decreases development costs since one builds upon existing code and a working and tested functionality. One risk however is that required features or bug fixes are not provided by the community as quickly as needed. To mitigate that risk, it might make sense to build up the required skills and create these bug fixes and/or features yourself. Contributing them back to the upstream projects has important benefits:

* Integrating "own" features into upstream projects makes maintenance a lot easier
* Upstream versions can be directly used in own products and services
* More features are obtained in shorter period of time
* Higher quality is achieved in shorter period of time
* Support available from core experts

### Exercise strategic influence

Despite the benefits wrt. development velocity and quality mentioned above, contributing to open source projects can also be important from a strategic point of view. In open source projects, reputaion and the ability to influence is typically build up by engaging in the community and by contributing. Thus, contributions to open source projects can help to ...

* influence the direction of upstream open source projects
* gain (co)copyright on open source software packages
* access to the creativity of everyone interested in software

Open source communities (particulary those run by the big open source foundations) provide a neutral place for collaboration between companies and other organizations. Thus, an open source approach could offer new ways of collaboration with suppliers, customers and partners may be established, just to mention industry- or domain-specific projects such as [Linux Foundation Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/) or [Eclipse Tractus-X](https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-tractus-x).Establishing open source communities can also be a powerful means to create and maintain ecosystems and to establish defacto standards.

### Attract, grow and retain talents

Software (and therefore also open source software) becomes more and more ubiqitous in many products and areas. Thus, for many companies (we are not only referring to software or cloud companies, but also to companies from other segments, such as traditional hardware producers who intergated software into their products) it is crucial to have a skilled and motivated software development workforce. An open source strategy including open source contributions and community engagements support this:

* Increase developer satisfaction
* Peer review of each contribution by core experts improves quality and boosts developer skills
* Make company visible as an attractive employer
* Improve company's reputation, and with it the standing of developers in their communities
